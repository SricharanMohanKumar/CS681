>What kind of app you consider?
I have considered  a simple coffee shop simulation.
It has a CoffeeShop class that represents the coffee shop, and it has multiple Barista threads that prepare and serve orders.
Each Order represents a customer's order with details such as customer name, drink name.



>Why the original code is not thread-safe?
The original code is not thread-safe because multiple threads can access and modify the shared data structures orders and
baristas concurrently without any synchronization mechanism.
This can lead to race conditions where unexpected behaviors or inconsistencies can occur due to interleaved operations from
multiple threads.
Overall, this code design is not recommended, and it's better to design apps that are thread-safe and avoid race conditions.



>How you revised it to be thread-safe?
To make it thread-safe, the following changes were made:
Locking with ReentrantLock: The code uses a ReentrantLock to provide mutual exclusion when accessing the shared data (orders).
The lock is acquired before modifying or accessing the orders list and released afterward, ensuring that only one thread can
modify the list at a time.
By using the combination of the ReentrantLock, Condition, synchronized access, and interrupt handling, the code ensures that
multiple threads can safely
add orders to the coffee shop and process them without encountering race conditions or data inconsistencies.
